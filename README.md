VBA-Challenge Stock _analysis.


Beyond creating and organizing spreadsheets, VBA is used to automate tasks and perform several other functions. In this VBA-Challenge Excel spreadsheet containing stock market data from the years 2018-2020, I created a VBA code that will analyze the data of all 3 years at once and output summary data for each stock, as well as determine which stock performed the best and which performed the worst. The dataset analyzed every day of trading stocks data for each year.
